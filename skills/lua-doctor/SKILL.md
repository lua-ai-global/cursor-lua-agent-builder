description: Diagnostic and assisted repair for the Lua plugin environment. Probes Node, npm, lua-cli, auth, and permission rules in order; offers explicit-consent fixes for each.

You are the entry point for `/lua-doctor`. Run a five-step diagnostic, stopping at the first red.

## Step 1 — Node ≥18

Run `Bash(node --version)`. Parse the major version. If <18:

- Detect the user's platform from your own session context (`Platform:` in the environment block — e.g. `darwin`, `linux`, `win32`). No Bash probe needed.
- Look up the install command via the §3.6 install matrix (macOS → `brew install node@20`; Linux → NodeSource APT or nvm; Windows → winget).
- ask-user-question: "Install Node 20 LTS via `<command>`?" with options `[Install now, Show me the command, Cancel]`.
- On confirm, run the install command. Re-probe.

## Step 2 — package manager

Run `Bash(npm --version)`. If non-zero, fall through to `pnpm --version`. If neither: ask-user-question to install via Node bundle or `corepack enable`.

## Step 3 — lua-cli

Run `Bash(lua --version)`. If not installed, ask-user-question to install via `npm install -g lua-cli`. If installed but below the version pinned in `hooks/check-lua-version.mjs` (`PINNED_MIN_LUA_CLI`), point at `/lua-update`.

## Step 4 — authentication

Run `Bash(lua agents --json --ci)`. The exit code tells us if auth works (0 = authenticated; non-zero = no/invalid key); the JSON body lists the user's orgs and agents (metadata, no secrets).

**Do NOT use `lua auth key --force`** as the auth probe. It prints the raw credential to stdout, which would put the credential in the Cursor conversation and model context.

If the command fails, invoke `/lua-auth`. That skill preserves any working legacy credential. For a new login, it requires `lua-cli` 3.28.0 or newer and sends the user to `lua auth configure` in a private terminal. Do not collect an email, an OTP, or a credential in this conversation. Do not recreate the old flag-based OTP flow here.

## Step 5 — permission rules

Plugin-level `settings.json` is silently ignored by Cursor for `permissions` keys (verified iter-12 audit). The plugin ships a template at `./lib/permissions-template.json` that the user must merge into their project's `.claude/settings.json` for the §3.7 single-permission contract to function.

- Read `./lib/permissions-template.json` (the canonical allow/ask/deny rules — strip the `_comment` field).
- Read the user's `.claude/settings.json` if it exists; otherwise treat as empty.
- Merge: union allow + ask + deny arrays from the template into the user's permissions block (skip duplicates by exact-string match).
- ask-user-question: "Plugin requires N allow / M ask / K deny rules to be added to .claude/settings.json. Apply?" with options `[Apply, Show me the diff, Skip (degrades §3.7 contract)]`.
- On Apply: write the merged settings.json. On Show diff: print the diff and re-ask.

If the user skips: print a one-line warning that every Bash invocation will trigger a permission prompt and the deploy-deny rule won't fire (the §3.3 hook still gates, but it's the only line of defence rather than the second).

Per §3.7, each step asks at most one permission interaction. Account details and credentials never enter this conversation.

After all five steps green, print "✓ Lua plugin ready. Try `/lua-init` to start a new agent project."
